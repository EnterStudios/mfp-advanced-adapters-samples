## Using Google Authenticator with IBM MobileFirst Platform security framework
[Google Authenticator](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Google_Authenticator) is a popular mobile application implementing the client side of [time based one-time password](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm).
This adapter provides the server-side implementation of one-time password, allowing seamless integration of Google Authenticator into
IBM MobileFirst Platform security framework.

## Implementation
The implementation consists of two components:

* REST interface for generation of the shared secret, and exposing it as a QR code.
* **googleOTP** security check that validates one-time passwords based on the shared secret.

A typical flow includes the following steps:

1. Mobile app initiates the setup by calling REST API for shared secret generation.
  This API is protected by a user authentication, so that the generated secret can be associated with a specific user.
2. The user types the QR code URL in her browser so that it could be scanned by Google Authenticator app
  This URL does not include any unique ID of the user or device.
  Instead this URL is protected by basic authentication, so that the user gets her last generated QR code.
3. The user scans the QR code with Google Authenticator, which completes the set up.

4. When the mobile application tries to access a resource protected by the **googleOTP** security check, it prompts the user to enter a one-time password.
5. The user invokes Google Authenticator, and submits one-time password generated by it to the application.
6. The security check validates the one-time password.  

### GoogleOTPResource
This class implements the REST API for generation and getting the shared secret.
It uses JAX-RS, Swagger, and MobileFirst security annotations.

### UserLoginSecurityCheck
A simple implementation of user login. Compares the username and password submitted by the client, and succeeds if they are the same.
This security check is used by GoogleOTPResource to protect the REST API.
Note that any other username/password login security check can be used instead. 

### GoogleOTPSecurityCheck
Implements the security check validating one-time password on top of the [wstrange/GoogleAuth](https://github.com/wstrange/GoogleAuth) open source project.

## Build and Setup

### Prerequisites
* A local installation of maven (JDK 1.7 or 1.8)
* Installed [Google Authenticator](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Google_Authenticator) App

### Build and install
* build the adapter application using maven:
    * From a **Command-line**, navigate to the **google-otp** project's root folder
    * Build the API using maven by executing `mvn clean install`
* Deploy the built adapter into your MobileFirst server by running `mvn adapter:deploy` (assure that your MobileFirst
  server connection parameters are updated in the **pom.xml** file)
* Log into the MobileFirst console and update the Adapter configuration parameters
    * qrCodeOrgName, The organization name that will appear in the [Google Authenticator](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Google_Authenticator) app after scan the QR code
    * qrCodeEmail, The email that will appear in the [Google Authenticator](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Google_Authenticator) app after scan the QR code
    * successStateExpirationSec, let you configure the time until the token created with Google OTP will be expired
* You are done
