A JAX-RS class that implement the REST API for setup and provisioning the Google Authenticator QR code URL.  The setup API needs to be ca×šled via mobile before call the QR Code URL API. 

### JAX-RS and Swagger Annotations
The resource class is annotated with both JAX-RS and Swagger annotations (and than also some Spring anotations and
potentially also MobileFirst security annotations).

**JAX-RS** annotations are used to mark the REST interfaces and marshal objects in and out of the REST interfaces. The
MobileFirst server uses those annotations to provide a custom Swagger test UI and meta data. The use of JAX-RS is
mandatory.

**Swagger** annotations are used to complete and improve the custom swagger test UI with more notes, description text
and type information. In general, the use of Swagger annotations to augment the swagger metadata is highly recommended,
but not mandatory.
